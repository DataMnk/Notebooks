# Semester Notebooks (CV · NLP · ML)

Lightweight, consistent structure to maintain through the semester.

## Structure
```
Computer_Vision/
  Week1_Intro/
    CV_week1_intro.ipynb
NLP/
  Week1_Intro/
    NLP_week1_intro.ipynb
Machine_Learning/
  Week1_Intro/
    ML_week1_intro.ipynb
```

## Suggested workflow
1) Duplicate the `Week1_Intro` folder each week (Week2_..., Week3_...).  
2) Keep notes in Markdown cells; keep demos tiny and runnable.  
3) Commit weekly to GitHub.  
4) To view nicely without running, paste the GitHub notebook URL into https://nbviewer.org/
