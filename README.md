# 📚 Semester Notebooks (Computer Vision · NLP · Machine Learning)

This repository contains my study notebooks for my **Fall 2025** courses:  
- 🖼️ **Computer Vision (CV)**  
- 📝 **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**  
- 🤖 **Machine Learning (ML)**  

Each week I update the notebooks with:  
- My personal notes (Markdown cells)  
- Code demos (Python)  
- Reflections and takeaways

## 🚀 Workflow  
 These instructions are mostly for me, can be hidden if repo is public 
1. Duplicate the `Week1_Intro` folder each week (`Week2_...`, `Week3_...`).  
2. Keep notes in Markdown cells + small runnable demos.  
3. Commit weekly to GitHub.  
4. To view notebooks nicely without running, paste the GitHub notebook URL into [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org).
